Que : Differentiate between append() and extend() methods?

In Python append() and extend() are list methods used to 
add items to a list.

append() is used for add a single item at the end of the list.

ex.,mylist=[1,2,3,4,5]
    mylist.append(6)
    print(mylist)
    output : [1,2,3,4,5,6]

extend() is used for adding multiple items at the end of the list.
It takes an iterable(list,tuple,string) as an argument and appends
each item in the iterable to the end of the list.

ex.,mylist=[1,2,3]
    additem=[4,5,6]
    mylist.extend(additem)
    print(mylist)
    output : [1,2,3,4,5,6]
