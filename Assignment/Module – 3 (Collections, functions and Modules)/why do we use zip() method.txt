Que : Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?

The zip() function in Python is used to combine two or more iterables (e.g., lists, tuples) 
into a single iterable object. It creates an iterator that aggregates elements from each of 
the iterables.

The most common use case for zip() is when you need to iterate over two or more lists simultaneously. 
Instead of using nested loops, which can be less efficient and harder to read, you can use zip() to 
create a new iterable that combines the elements of the input iterables.
