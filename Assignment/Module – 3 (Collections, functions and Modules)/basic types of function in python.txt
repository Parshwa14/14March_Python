Que : How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?

->In Python, there are two basic types of functions:

1)Built-in Functions: These are the functions that are built into 
  the Python language and are always available to use. 
  
  -Examples include print(), len(), str(), int(), float(), etc.

2)User-defined Functions: These are the functions that you can 
  define yourself in your Python code. 
  
  -You can create your own functions to perform specific tasks 
   and reuse them throughout your code. 
  
  -User-defined functions are defined using the def keyword followed 
   by the function name, input parameters (if any), and the code block 
   that defines the function's behavior.
