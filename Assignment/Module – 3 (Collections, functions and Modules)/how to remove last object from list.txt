Que :How will you remove last object from a list?  
     Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], 
     what is list1 [-1]?

To remove the last object from a list, we can use 
inbuilt method pop() with no argument.
ex., mylist.pop()

we can also use 'del' statement to remove the last item.
ex., del mylist[-1]

list1[-1] will print the last object from the list1
