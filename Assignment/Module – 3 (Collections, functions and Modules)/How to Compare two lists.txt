Que : How will you compare two lists?

There are several ways to compare two lists.

1) Using the '==' operator. The simplest way
to compare two lists is to use the '==' operator.
This will return 'True' if both lists have the same
elements in the same order, and 'False' otherwise.


2) Using the 'set()' function: Another way to compare
two lists is to convert them into sets and compare
them using the '==' operator. This method will ignore
the order of the elements in the lists.


3) Using a loop: You can also compare two lists by iterating 
over them and comparing each element.
