Que : What are negative indexes and why are they used?

Negative indexes are used in programming languages to 
access elements of an array or a list from the end, 
rather than from the beginning. 

In other words, a negative index is an offset from the end 
of the sequence, rather than from the beginning.

For example, in a list or array with n elements, the 
index -1 refers to the last element, -2 refers to the 
second-to-last element, and so on.

Negative indexes are useful when you want to access elements 
in a sequence from the end, without having to know the length 
of the sequence beforehand. They are commonly used in situations 
where you need to iterate over a sequence backwards, or when 
you need to access the last few elements of a sequence.

In some programming languages, like Python, negative indexes are 
also used to slice a sequence. 

For example, to get the last three elements of a list, you can use 
the slice my_list[-3:]
